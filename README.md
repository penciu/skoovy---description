Skoovy is a social network whereby users can post short videos to the community publicly or to their friends privately. Each video is posted to a geo-location on a map and associated with hash-tags and a category. Users can not only post at will to the site but users can also request information in the form of a video based on a specific location and time of day. 

When a user requests information about a place, they lose a point, when answering a question by providing content to the site they gain a point. Users who receive comments and/or likes to a video are given points as well and these points determine what videos are shown first to a location.

Each location that receives content would display content to users on a map based on time first. So for example, if a location has received 10 videos all within the last 10 minutes, the latest video would be shown first but also based on the point system.  

So that a location is not overwhelmed with content. We will display up to 6 videos per location until new content is added. Historical videos will only be kept if nothing new is added to a location.
